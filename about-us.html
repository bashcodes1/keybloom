    <h1 align="left">  Our Story</h1>

    <p align="left">
      <p align="left"> Keybloom is a music publishing company founded in 2016 by Bawo Okoroh in Lagos, Nigeria. From the very beginning, our goal has been to discover and promote the talents of emerging artists, helping them reach a wider audience and achieve success in the music industry.</p>  
  <p align="left">  Since our founding, we have worked with a variety of artists across a range of genres, helping them secure publishing deals and navigate the complex world of the music industry. In addition to publishing, we also offer services such as music and video distribution, public relations, and global royalty collection to help our artists succeed.</p>

 <p align="left">One of the things that sets us apart from other music publishing companies is our commitment to education and support. We believe that knowledge is power, and so we offer a range of sync licensing webinars to help artists understand the process of securing sync licenses and get their music placed in film, TV, and other media.</p> 
  <p align="left">  As a company based in Nigeria, we are also committed to promoting and supporting the local music scene. We believe that there is so much talent in this country, and we are proud to be able to help these artists reach a global audience.</p>

 <p align="left"> We are grateful for the opportunity to work with such talented and creative artists, and we are always looking for new and innovative ways to support and promote their work. We are excited to see what the future holds for Keybloom and the artists we work with, and we look forward to continuing to be a driving force in the music industry.</p>
